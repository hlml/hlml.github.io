About
<ul>
Hi, good day! <br><br>
  
I am a data scientist at Uber where I build econometric and machine learning models to support the forecasting and planning needs of Uber marketers globally. 
In my spare time, I work on machine learning research with the Deep Collective team at Uber AI Labs. 
My research focuses on understanding how and why neural networks work, and is based on the belief that the performance of modern neural networks far exceeds our understanding of them and that bridging this gap is a crucial step to building better, more trusted models.<br><br>
  
Before getting into the world of machine learning, I was an undergraduate at the Ivey Business School in Canada, where I studied finance and entrepreneurship. Prior to Uber, I worked as a private equity analyst at Radar Capital, and then as an economic consultant at Cornerstone Research.
