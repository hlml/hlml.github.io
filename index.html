About
     
<ul>
<div style="width: 650px; word-wrap: break-word">
Good day! I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.umontreal.ca/">Université de Montréal</a> and <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">Mila</a>, where I am supervised by <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/person/hugo-larochelle/">Hugo Larochelle</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=km6CP8cAAAAJ&hl=en">Aaron Courville</a>.<br><br>

     
I am currently interning at <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/">Apple MLR</a> with <a href="https://preetum.nakkiran.org/">Preetum Nakkiran</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Sv2TGqsAAAAJ&hl=en">Josh Susskind</a> and  <a href="https://bengio.abracadoudou.com/">Samy Bengio</a>. 
I was also a student researcher at <a href="https://research.google/">Google Brain</a> in 2022, working with <a href="https://haniesedghi.com/">Hanie Sedghi</a> and <a href="https://www.neyshabur.net/">Behnam Neyshabur</a> on making large language models reason better.<br><br>

Prior to Mila, I was a data scientist at Uber where I built econometric and machine learning models to measure and optimize marketing spend globally. 
I also had the fortune of doing research with wonderful folks at Uber AI Labs (now <a href="http://mlcollective.org/">ML Collective</a>). 
My research focuses on understanding how and why neural networks work, and is based on the belief that the performance of modern neural networks far exceeds our understanding of them and that bridging this gap is a crucial step to building better, more trusted models.<br><br>
  
Before getting into the world of machine learning, I was an undergraduate at the <a href="https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/hba/">Ivey Business School</a> in <a href="https://cheezburger.com/6955013/16-canada-memes-thatll-give-you-a-strong-urge-to-apologize-for-everything">Canada</a>, 
     where I studied finance and entrepreneurship. 
     Prior to Uber, I worked as a private equity analyst at Radar Capital, and then as an economic consultant at <a href="https://www.cornerstone.com/">Cornerstone Research</a>.
